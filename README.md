# darkan-plugins

Welcome to my half-assed public plugin development release attempt #1.

If you would like to help develop plugins for the server, use the dev-resources and example plugins as a reference for how it can work.
The project is set up to be an Eclipse project by default including the lib folder using Java 11.
